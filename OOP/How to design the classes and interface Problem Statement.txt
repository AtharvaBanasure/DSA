How to design the classes and interfaces for the following scenario:

Tom and Bob work for a school.
Tom works as a manager and as a teacher.
Bob works as a teacher.
A teacher's behavior is to teach the students and
a manager's behavior is to manage school employees.

Please refactor below code as per good design principles.

public interface Person {}
/
public interface Manager extends Person {
public void manageEmployees();
}

public interface Teacher extends Person {
public void teachStudents();
}

public class Tom implements Manager, Teacher {

@Override
public void manageEmployees() {
//implementation goes here
}

@Override
public void teachStudents() {
//implementation goes here
}
}

public class Bob implements Teacher {

@Override
public void teachStudents() {
//implementation goes here
}
}

public class School {

public static void main(String[] args) {
Tom tom = new Tom();
tom.manageEmployees();
tom.teachStudents();

Bob bob = new Bob();
bob.teachStudents();
}
}
